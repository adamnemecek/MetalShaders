# MetalShaders
##Authors: Chirag Raman <chirag.raman@gmail.com>, Tyler Zhu <tyler24.nl@gmail.com>

This project constitutes our exploration into Metal Shader programming. 
The intention is to use [Inigo Quilez's shaders from Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/iq) as references and port them to Metal.
